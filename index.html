							<h2>Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
							<strong class="headerPolicy">Terms & Conditions</strong>
							<p class="textPolicy">
								By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you ‚Äì you
								should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You‚Äôre not
								allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way.
								You‚Äôre not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also
								shouldn‚Äôt try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions.
								The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other
								intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Ajay Shanker.

								</br></br>
								Ajay Shanker is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as
								possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge
								for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app
								or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you‚Äôre paying for.
								</br></br>
								The GreenCrateSG app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order
								to provide my Service. It‚Äôs your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app
								secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is
								the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official
								operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
								malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone‚Äôs security features and it
								could mean that the GreenCrateSG app won‚Äôt work properly or at all.

								</br>
								The app does use third party services that declare their own
								Terms and Conditions.

								You should be aware that there are certain things that Ajay Shanker will not take
								responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active
								internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network
								provider, but Ajay Shanker cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
								functionality if you don‚Äôt have access to Wi-Fi, and you don‚Äôt have any of your data
								allowance left.
								</br></br>
								If you‚Äôre using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your
								terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result,
								you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
								connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app,
								you‚Äôre accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if
								you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning
								off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you‚Äôre using the
								app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill
								payer for using the app.
								</br></br>
								Along the same lines, Ajay Shanker cannot always take responsibility for the way you use
								the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged ‚Äì if it runs out of
								battery and you can‚Äôt turn it on to avail the Service, Ajay Shanker cannot accept
								responsibility.
								</br></br>
								With respect to Ajay Shanker‚Äôs responsibility for your use of the app, when you‚Äôre using
								the app, it‚Äôs important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
								updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to
								us so that we can make it available to you. Ajay Shanker accepts no liability for any
								loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
								functionality of the app.
								</br></br>
								At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android
								& iOS ‚Äì the requirements for both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to
								extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you‚Äôll need to download the
								updates if you want to keep using the app. Ajay Shanker does not promise that it will
								always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS
								version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept
								updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the
								app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to
								you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses
								granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
								delete it from your device.
							</p>
							<p class="textPolicy"><strong class="headerPolicy">Changes to This Terms and
